Getting started with beekeeping is indeed pretty straightforward. But, it can be challenging for a newbie if you don't have a mentor. The main thing is getting started and you learn your way out with time. In my opinion, trying to learn everything before getting started is a bad strategy.

In this post, I try to outline what is needed and how to get started.

**Location:**

The first thing before starting beekeeping is to make sure you have a good location for bees. A typical single-family backyard would do it. There are people who keep bees in balconies but I personally don't recommend that. You need to make sure local regulation allows having bees in your backyard; this is typically handled at city-level. Generally, keeping bees in residential areas is allowed if it is not for commercial purpose. There can be limit on how many hives you can have so check your local regulations (google is your friend).

Although there are different opinion on this, it is commonly accepted that your hives should be placed in a location where they get the earliest sunshine in the morning. The idea is to "wake them up" early to go out and collect pollen and nectar.

_Note:_ If you need to move your hives after you've installed bees, you need to follow certain procedure so don't assume you can move your hives around frequently. Do your research.

**How many hives?**

If you are a new beekeeper, start with two or three hives. It is not recommended to start with a single hive. With two hives, you can swap brood-frames, honey or queen cells between hives. This might be helpful if you have a weak colony.

**Hive types and where to get them:**

Follow the [flowchart in beebuilt.com](https://beebuilt.com/pages/the-best-bee-hive) to find-out which hive type is best for you. I personally have only used topbar hives and so far so good.

Once you select a hive type, you can purchase the hives from your local beekeeping supply store or you can order online. Here are some good options from amazon.com:

- [Topbar hive](https://www.amazon.com/Beeline-Apiaries-Top-Bar-Hive/dp/B0722LP7K9/)
- [Langstroth hive](https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Hive-Painted-Assembled-10-Frame/dp/B00B8L5ZJ6/)

Alternatively, build your hive from scratch (see my post with [topbar hive plan](https://www.tevfikyucek.com/topbar-beehive-plan/)) or search Craigslist for local deals.

**Tools:**

The basics you need are: [hive tool](https://www.amazon.com/KINGLAKE-J-Hook-Scraper-Beekeeping-Equipment/dp/B010NBUC08/), [gloves](https://www.amazon.com/NATURAL-APIARY-Beekeeping-Elasticated-Gauntlets/dp/B014HPJ09K/), [suit](https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Breeze-Large-Beekeeping-1-Unit/dp/B007PP1YNU), [smoker](https://www.amazon.com/Hoont-Commercial-Grade-Smoker-Beekeeping/dp/B01HFI745S/), and [beekeeping brush](https://www.amazon.com/Little-Giant-Farm-Ag-BKBR14/dp/B00PX93U32/).

The link above for the suite is for a "ultra-breeze suit". I don't have one but I would definitely get one if I did not already have a suite. In the hot summer days, the thick cotton cloth is not very comfortable so go for a Ultra-breeze one.

**Bees:**

Bees are the most important item you would need for getting started. Beekeeping supply stores usually take order around December-January time and you can pick up them in early Spring. Don't forget to order them early.

If you don't want to pay for bees, how about catching a swarm?
