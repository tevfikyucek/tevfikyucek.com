One annoying thing (among many others) that I have come across using MS word is that it might split even small tables across multiple pages. Fortunately, there is a way to prevent this behavior. Here is how:

1. Select the first column of the table that you want to keep in a single page,
2. Select "Format"--\>"Paragraph" from the menu bar,
3. In the dialog window that opens, select "Line and Page Breaks" tab and enable "Keep with next" option,
4. Click "Ok" to accept the changes.

This worked for me on MS Office 2003 and I guess it will also work in never versions of Office.
