I've realized that there are a lot of people (mostly EE students) looking for some Matlab code to run [OFDM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_frequency-division_multiplexing) simulations. The best way to learn is to write the code yourself. It takes a lot longer to achieve a task but it will sure make you learn! That said, long time ago, I have used the code that came with a book titled "[OFDM Wireless LANs: A Theoretical and Practical Guide](https://www.amazon.com/OFDM-Wireless-LANs-Theoretical-Practical/dp/0672321572/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1269099109&sr=1-1)" by Juha Heiskala and John Terry. Amazon reviewers state that the book has many errors in equations but I think it is a very good introduction to OFDM. All of the commonly used algorithms from channel estimation to synchronization are explained. By reading this book, you can start building your OFDM own system.

The source code for an IEEE 802.11a based WLAN system included with the book can be downloaded from [here](http://www.informit.com/store/ofdm-wireless-lans-a-theoretical-and-practical-guide-9780672321573). Just click the "download" link at the bottom of the book's description. The simulator is also a good example on how to build a structured simulator for any communication system.
