# Summary

If copy-past is not working on OneNote for Windows 10, open settings for OneNote and tap on "Repair" or "Reset" button. 

# Background

I use OneNote for work extensively to capture meeting minutes and share with the rest of my team. It is a great utility that helps organize notes, thoughts, various information and in some cases design/system specs. Search feature works very nicely and I can easily locate information that I have captured many years back.

After a recent update, copy-paste stopped working. Sometimes it worked, but most of the time, I could not copy-paste text from one page to another or within the same page. Super annoying.

I've [searched online](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=onenote+copy+paste+not+working&t=hk&ia=web) and followed the first link that points to a [Microsoft forum](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/all/onenote-for-windows-10-paste-doesnt-work-with/367f7a7b-cac4-40e5-b5de-da9989fb4965). Funny thing is "Microsoft Agent" recommends to "*try uninstalling and reinstalling your OneNote application and check if will make any difference*". I don't even know how to do that as my PC is managed by the company IT department.

After further searching I found another solution which recommended finding OneNote settings under system settings app, but there is no specific settings for OneNote. 

# Detailed Solution

What worked for me is:
1. Click on **Start** button in Windows 10 (lower left corner).
2. Type _Onenote_ in search bar (you can directly start typing). That would show OneNote as the Best Match. 
3. Now you can either 
	- Right click on "OneNote for Windows 10" or 
	- Tap on the circular down arrow to bring up a menu of options (Open, Pin to Start, App Settings, Uninstall etc.)
4. Tap on **Settings**. 
5. Tap on **Repair** button.

That did it for me and copy-paste started working as expected. If **Repair** button does not work, you can try **Reset** button as well.
