During our family trip to Maui/Hawaii in 2019, we drove the scenic “[Road to Hana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hana_Highway)” as any new tourist would do. Unluckily, we chose a wrong day since it rained pretty much whole morning during our drive. After 2-3 hours driving with beautiful views, it gets boring ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

In Hana, we were looking for attractions and beaches for kids to spend some time before we head back. Hana is a small town and there is not much to do or to see. I have identified [Red Sand Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sand_Beach) on the tourist guide and decided to visit. There was one issue, where is this beach and how do you access it? The thing is there is no entrance to this beach. Our navigation system took us to a dead-end road and there was a closed gate to a resort. No signs for a beach.  We were almost turning back when we asked a lady, who was obviously returning from the beach, about the beach and she showed us the way. She also said “It is beautiful” and she was right!

Now, to reach the beach, you need to go through a private property where there are signs in every corner that says “No Trespassing”, “The trail is Dangerous”, and even “PEOPLE DIE HERE!”.  If we hadn’t seen a family with kids coming back from the beach, we probably would have turned back based on these signs.

The trail was narrow, hilly and slippery due to rain earlier in the morning. I can not say it was easy, but we made it to the beach in around 15-20 minutes, even with our then 3 years old. The view during most of the hiking was phenomenal. And the beach was something out of this world! Unfortunately, we were not prepared and did not have towels and clothes so we could not really enjoy the water completely, but the trip was still worth all the risk we took :).

None of the pictures in this post uses filters. These pictures do not do justice to the beauty of this place. It was simply stunning and was surely  the highlight of our trip to Hana. 

NOTE: We have seen a police officer writing tickets to cars parked on the road, so make sure you park legally.
