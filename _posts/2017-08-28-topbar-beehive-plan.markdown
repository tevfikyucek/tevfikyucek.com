For all my 3 hives, I've followed the plan from [Les Crowder's wonderful book](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009OJ592C/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_hsch_vapi_taft_p1_i0). I have a copy of the plan posted below in case you don't have the book yet.

I like Crowder's plan because it is minimal and does not have any unnecessary accessories like observation window. BTW, two of my hives have observation windows which are pain to build and I never use them.

Needless to say following the same plan for all hives would enable one to use the top-bars across multiple hives and you can also swap frames between hives.
