One of the side products of beekeeping is beeswax. In the past, I've used beeswax to make moisturizing lotion and my wife was using some of it as diaper cream for our daughter. So, this week I've made a small batch of diaper rash cream. There are different recipes in the web and I am sure all is great. We mainly use olive oil for cooking at home so I used it and mixed olive oil with coconut oil.

**Ingredients:**

- 2 oz beeswax
- 10 oz coconut oil
- 8 oz olive oil
- 6-8 drops of rose essential oil (optional)
- 4 teaspoon zinc oxide powder

**How to make:**

Setup a double-boiler (I've used old pans), and place coconut oil, olive oil and beeswax in the pan. When everything melts, add zinc dioxide powder and mix thoroughly. Add the essential oil drops and pour the creams into containers.

**Notes:**

- You can scale amount of cream anyway you want.
- If you don't add zinc oxide, you get a nice hand lotion.
- I've bought [this zinc oxide package](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MY0OCFD?th=1) from Amazon. It is a small packet and cost less than others. Also organic.
