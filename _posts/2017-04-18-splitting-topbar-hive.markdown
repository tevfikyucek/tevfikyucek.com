This weekend, I've split the two hives into three by taking brood frames from older two hives and placing them into the empty hive.

Unfortunately, I could not find neither queen so we took a change on that one.. My daughter recorded the video for me and added explanations.

I will report on the progress in the new hive in the upcoming videos.
